Crypto-Coin Conf Creator
=====================

Create .conf files for your cryptocurrency wallets with this C++/Qt interface

=====================

Created for use by the ATOMIC project to allow users to easily set RPC settings.
Also serves the purpose of allowing cryptocurrency wallets to specify required,
or suggested settings that should be placed into the configuration file when the 
user first runs the wallet. As this is a widget it can also be placed inside of 
any Qt layout that is inside of the wallet, allowing users to change their rpc
settings at any time from within the wallet GUI.
